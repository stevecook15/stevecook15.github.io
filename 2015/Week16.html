Well, the problem with counting on smoke, mirrors and dumb luck is that at some point the
smoke clears, the mirror cracks and luck just plain runs out. The Flat Bastards finally paid
the piper and had probably the lowest championship score in our leagues history. And to add
insult to injury the Pope rubbed their faces in it by scoring the high score for the year for the
league, and beating their projected score by 62 points (as opposed to the Turds who pooped out 40 pts
under their projected score).  Congrats to the Foamies in defending their crown!<br><br>

Well, on to next year...
