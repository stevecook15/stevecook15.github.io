Sometimes ya gotta just roll with good fortune (ok dumb luck), with the third lowest score of the week and
still trailing with a minute to go a one yd TD save the Bastards and move to the finals.  Is it kismet,
destiny, fate for them to take home the big prize, or will it all come crushingly down to defeat in the
finals against the obviously superior Styro Popes, who took care of their playoff opponent in a workman
like fashion (ho hum).  Good luck to both.
