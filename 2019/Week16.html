Congrats to the Bellis!  After a high scoring effort worthy of the PFL championship the Bellis come out ahead
in a 3pt squeaker to beat the Nubs!  Oh, wait... they both were pathetic but one of them had to win.  Way 
to go I guess...  I'd go on and on about this exciting matchup but I never was good at writing fiction.

Wouldn't you know it - both the Tide and the Fat would have beaten the Belis and Nubs this
week. Actually, every team in the consolation bracket would have beat them.  Ain't timing a
bitch? But at least the Tide have the satisfaction of winning the bronze!  The Fat on the other
hand started the season with a two game losing streak and ended with a two game losing streak.
Some questionable management on their part hurt also - if they'd just played their all year long
starting QB instead of picking up some broken down retread QBto play just this one week  they'd
have picked up third.  Sigh!
