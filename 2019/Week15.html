After playing dead for the last 12 weeks of the regular season the Nubs arose (we'll insist their team name
is The Possums next year) for their second highest score of the year (highest since week 1 in fact). The
Fat had no chance event despite beating their projected score by around 15 pts.<br><br>
In the other semi-final the Belis checked the Tides roll in a much closer but lower scoring affair, leaving
the Fat to wonder why they didn't get to play one of them.<br><br>
So the two division winners move on (fitting I guess) to the final while the Fat get their nearly annual
chance for 3rd place (what would be their fifth 3rd place finish is seven years).<br><br>
In other games the Ice and Krusties are just left saying hey, I could've beaten 3 of the 4 playoff teams,
 moving into the Consolation bracket finals.
