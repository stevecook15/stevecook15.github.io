Guess it pays to be a tight ass as the <i><b>Tenacious Anus</b></i> put a butt whipping on the Seamen,
with the Anus more than doubling the Seakids scorer, to win the PFL championship! The Seamen, who were
probably the most consistent team all year, sure picked the worst time to have an off week with their
worst score of the year! There's probably at least eight other PFL teams going: hell, my team could
have done that!<br><br>
Speaking of other teams, the Porkchops held off the Predators Monday night in a close battle to stay
out of that dreaded out of the money fourth place finish! The Chops take home 3rd place money to go
with that division title, so kaching...

<p><font>In the much more important Chumpionship game, the Bastards got fatter, setting their high
score for the season (where's that been all season???) for an easy win to take fifth, sending the 
Belichecks to the Clearance/Final Closeout rack, and finally winning a game against the Pro
division for the first time this yer! What's that you say, no money for being Chumpions either?
Damn it! Grumble, grumble...<br><br>
And in the seventh place game, the Iceotopes cooled down the Hot Choco's, who're saying: Well,
guess its better than being ninth.  Side Note: In a first for the year the Bad Division went
undefeated against the Good division. So there! See what meaningless games will do for ya?
