As the old saying (sorta) goes, ya just gotta get to the dance because on any given sunday.
Well, for three of the four 6-8 teams that barely squeaked their way into the playoffs, it
was that Sunday!  They took down three of the four top seeds to show that, pheh, the regular
seasons overrated.<br><br>Stop me if you've heard this before - the number one seeded team, with the
regular seasons best record, highest scoring averge and lowest opponent average, promptly
loses in the first round of the playoffs to a suddenly hot 8th seed, who posts the high score
for the week. No, I'm not talking about 2023 Phat Bastards, I'm talking about the 2024 <i>Phat
Bastards</i> - it's like deja vu all over again. The Bastards are threatening to throw games next
year just to avoid the number one seed!  The <i>Cocos</i> are pretty excited about this of course
because last years 8th seed went on to win the championship after smashing the Phat.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the 6-8 <i>Weapons of Shaheed Destruction</i> posted the second highest score of the week
to upset the <i>She Sheds</i> who picked the wrong week to post their lowest score of the year. Also
meanwhile the 6-8 <i>Iceolinear Totes</i> had the third highest score of the week (I'm sensing a
trend here...) to <i>Nix Their Hopes</i> (at least it was closer than the other two matchups.<br><br>
But congrats to the <i>Pork Loins</i> for actually walking the chalk and slinking by the 6-8 <i>No 
Comeback Miracles Here, Move Along, Move Along</i>. Too bad the Porkies have to face the dreaded
8th seed this next week!
