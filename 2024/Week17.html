Whoa, deja vu all over again! The eigth seed romps its way to becoming the PFL Champion! Didn't
that happen last year? Oh wait, it did! Congrats to the mighty Coco Browns for winning the league
beating the Iceotopes who were apparently were either just glad to be there or lost all their stars
in the transfer portal.<br><br>Also, slightly smaller congrats to the Weapons of Bass Destruction
taking out the 2nd seeded Porkchops to secure third place (and all the glory and loot that comes
with it).

And oh yeah, The Comeback Miracle did, coming back to beat That's What Shaheed Said to
take 5th and the Phat Bastards (who were just glad their opponent didn't have the weeks high
score) took 7th by beating the Nix UR Hopes. Wheee!
