Last season the 8th seeded team took out the 1st seed in the first round and took out the 2nd
seed in the second round to reach the PFL Championship.
Well, that exact scenario has played out again this year as the Coco's will play in the Phantom
Bowl Spectacular for the their 1st ever title after they Chopped the 2nd seeded Pork.  Last
season the Iceotopes got hot at the right time and went to the Super Bowl where they were summarily
disposed of by the Preds.  And here we go again, as the Ice won their quarter and semi-final
matchups, beating the Weapons of Bass Destruction this week, so will play in the Phantom Bowl
Spectacular for the 2nd year in a row!  Lots of
nutty coincidences this season.  So it'll be interesting to see if the Ice learned anything
from last years experience, or if Coco can show experience doesn't matter at all in this battle
of two 8-8 juggernauts.<br><br>In the Consolation Match, the Weapons of Bass Destruction, despite
posting the low score of the week, will take on the #2 seeded Pork for chance at 3rd place moola.
