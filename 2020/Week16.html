Wouldn't you know it - both the Tide and the Fat would have beaten the Belis and Nubs this
week. Actually, every team in the consolation bracket would have beat them.  Ain't timing a
bitch? But at least the Tide have the satisfaction of winning the bronze!  The Fat on the other
hand started the season with a two game losing streak and ended with a two game losing streak.
Their first week playoff score would have beat any other team in either week of the playoff were
it not for a miracle week from the Nubs the first week.  And, as I said already... ain't timing a
bitch.  Some questionable management on the Fats  part hurt also - if they'd just played their all
year long starting QB instead of picking up some broken down retread QB to play just this one
week they'd have at least picked up third.  Sigh!
