<p><font size="-1">Seems like cream isn't the only thing that rises to the top... apparently pork also floats!
The Chops, after taking a late season break, showed why they led the league the whole year and left no doubt as
to the 2020 PFL winner, overwhelming the Tight Spchinters who put up a decent number but it wasn't to
be!  All hail the Porksters!

what a long strange trip it's been (obscure 70's rock reference for the old guys).  See ya all next year and
maybe it'll be more normal! And the Phat wins!
