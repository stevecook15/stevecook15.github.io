Normally in the playoffs if your team scored 123 pts you'd expect to be crying in your double tall caramel non-fat
no whip machiato, not moving on to the championship, but the iceotopes had the incredible fortune of playing the
coldest team in the league who had spent the last month backing their way into the playoffs. The Fat have been
Flat for a while now.<br><br>
And there'll be no 3-peat, as the dreaded Popes were finally dethroned by some Predators, with the highest
score of the week - a pedestrian 145 points enough this week. But after being the top team in the league for the
first 13 weeks, only to be knocked off the last week, they showed they're still here, so we get to see if predators
like to eat ice smoothies or not.<br><br>

<br><br>And the consolation game is a rematch of last years championshipa, where the Fat put up probably the worst
playoff effort in PFL history and one we fully expect to see a repeat of, given the Bastards incredibly bad
efforts of late.
