It's all over, the fat lady's singing, the jello's jiggling, the Iceotopes deep freezes the Predators.
Congrats to the Topes, the regular season and playoff winners. And a close but not quite to the Preds who
led the league for the first 13 weeks. Fitting that the championship featured the two highest scores of
the week, no pretenders here.<br><br>
In the 'Who Cares' bowl, the Bastards came out on top, finally putting an end to the smoke and mirrors
Foamers season, to take third which they're more than happy with considering they lucked into a playoff
berth in the first place.<br><br>
As to the rest of the league, well, take this as a learning season and better luck next year!
