<p>While the NFL has not finished up with week 17 there is zero chance that the 1st through 4th
place matchups result will change if/when they do, we can go ahead and call it fait accompli.</p>
<p>
Congrats to the <b>Naturals</b>. Makes sense that the highest scoring team in the league wins the
big prize. Not that the <b>Bastards</b> put up much of a fight, with (probably) their second lowest score of the
year. Every other team in the playoffs is going: <i>Hell, my team beat that!</i> Turns out 5 of 6 other
teams would have beat both the finalists! Ah, timings a bitch ain't it?

Well, third place bucks are not zero bucks after all! A hot <b>Tide</b> rolled in and melted the <b>Ice</b>
with the high score in the league this week. Well done, well done.

<!-- Well, this is what a championship match <i>should</i> look like. Close score with both teams scoring above
their projections (and higher scores than the two teams in the championship final!).  Poor consolation but the 
Predators won the non-playoffs bracket leaving them selves to wonder what might have been... -->
