<p>
In the first matchup it seems the number one seed <b>Phat Bastards</b> (13-2) took umbrage to Yahoo projecting the number four
seed <b>Roll Tide</b> (8-7) to win by 20 pts (by far the Bastards largest projected deficit of the year) and responded with
their highest score of the year. When the Tide failed to meet their original projection it was the Bastards winning
by 20+ pts instead! 
In the second matchup the <b>Najee By Nature</b> (10-5) outlasted a game effort by the <b>Iceotopes</b> (9-6) who'd fought
their way into the playoffs but just couldn't get enough out of their MNF players to catch up.</p><p>
</p>
<p>
And so now we have, in a more seldem seen than expected result, the top two seeds reach the PFL finals! THe two
division winners battling it out for the big prize! Based in this next weeks projected points (using this weeks
lineups) it'll be basically a tossup!
The Tide and Topes will battle it out for the important (prize paying) third spot.

<p>
Hopes of fifth place glory still continue for the <b>Coco Browns</b> and the <b>Predators</b> as they
both easily took care of their opponents <b>Discount Belichceck</b> and the <b>Tenacious Anus</b>, respectively.
